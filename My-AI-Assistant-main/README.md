  Project Description: Gemini API Assistant

 Introduction
This project is an innovative use of the Gemini API for creating a voice-activated assistant that retrieves answers to user-provided questions and converts them to speech for auditory feedback. The integration of the Gemini API with Google Colab allows for seamless execution in a collaborative environment.

Features
The Gemini API Assistant offers the following features:
1. Question and Answer Retrieval**: Users can input questions, and the assistant utilizes the Gemini API to retrieve accurate answers.
2. Text-to-Speech Conversion**: The responses are converted into speech, providing users with auditory feedback.
3. Colab Integration**: The entire project is executed within Google Colab, enabling collaborative development and real-time accessibility.

Usage
To utilize the Gemini API Assistant, follow these steps:
1. Input Question**: Input your question into the designated interface.
2. Execute API Retrieval**: The assistant will conduct an API call to Gemini for fetching the answer.
3. Voice Output**: The retrieved answer will be converted to speech and played aloud for user convenience.
